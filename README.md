# Transfer Learning Using DCGAN Network

In this project, I have used transfer learning by first training the DCGAN network on a CIFAR-100 Dataset then using those trained weights for classification on Food 101 dataset and used a linear SVM for the feature classification. 

I have got an accuracy for 50% percent for few classes even without using whole dataset.
